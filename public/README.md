## Reece Jones

I'm a **full stack developer** and graduate of Scotland's immersive software development bootcamp: [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/).  I'm looking for a challenging full time position where I can build **clean, functional, and expandable** code.

My greatest strength is tenacity and slight obsessiveness towards problem solving. I spent several months before **CodeClan** learning to code for fun before considering it as a career. I have a proven ability to rapidly pick up new concepts and apply them. I studied Psychology and find interaction between machine and man of particular interest, and I love to see the design of code develop from the interaction with people.

## Projects
Since finishing at CodeClan in September 2017 I have completed a short contract which involved building a fundraising platform (using Rails 5 API backend with authentication, and Json Web tokens, which communicated with a React JavaScript frontend).

I have knowledge in the following:

Languages | Frameworks | Libraries
---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
Ruby | Rails 5 | Devise, JWT, Responders
Java | Android Studio | junit
JavaScript | React, React-native, Node | Redux, Axios, Google-maps, and lots more
HTML5 | Bootstrap | |
CSS3 | SCSS | |
SQL | Mysql, Sqlite, Psql | |
Mongodb | | Mongoose

Here are some samples of my completed work:
